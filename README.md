symphony-extensions
===================

A bunch of extensions that are supposed to be bundled with the new release of Symphony CMS, all bundled together for easy drag-and-drop installation awesomeness.

Simply unzip the file, then copy all the extension folders within to the "extensions" folder in your symphony installation.

Once this has been done, you can install all the extensions normally through the extensions panel in the CMS.

This repo exists because for some reason, the new version of Symphony CMS hiccups and doesn't come packaged with any of the extensions installed....
